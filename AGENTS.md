# Agent instructions

This repository is intentionally minimal and used for experimenting with agentic coding workflows.

## Expectations

- Keep changes small and reversible.
- Avoid adding secrets (API keys, tokens, `.env` files).
- Prefer drafting PRs first. Mark PRs "Ready for review" only when checks pass and the diff is final.

## Local verification

There is no standard build/lint/test setup in this repo yet.

If you add tooling, also add the corresponding run commands to this section (for example `npm run lint`, `npm run build`, `npm test`, etc.) and ensure they pass locally.
