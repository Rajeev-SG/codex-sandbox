# Agent instructions

This repository is intentionally minimal and used for experimenting with agentic coding workflows.

## Expectations

- Keep changes small and reversible.
- Avoid adding secrets (API keys, tokens, `.env` files).
- Prefer drafting PRs first. Mark PRs "Ready for review" only when checks pass and the diff is final.

## Setup
- `make setup`

## Testing
- `make lint`
- `make typecheck`
- `make coverage`
- `make docs`
